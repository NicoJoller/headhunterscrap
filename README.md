# Capstone Project: Headhunter Scraper

This is my project where I try to scrap data from different headhunter websites. Then I look for some predefined keywords which provides information about the company's service offerings.

This project is related to my employment at a Swiss accident insurance company. In my role, I am currently leading a project regarding the collaboration between HR and external personnel service providers. This includes evaluating the current partners. To obtain information in advance about the services offered by these partners, I am writing this code.  The aim of this code is to generate an initial overview for me of which partners offer which services.

This is the final edition of my project.

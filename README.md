# headhunterscrap
This is my project where I try to scrap data from different headhunter websites. Then I look for some predefined keywords which provides information about the company's service offerings.

My goal is to find out which of the (c.a. 93) companys offer wich services.

This is a work in progress project. I will keep updating this project as I make progress.
